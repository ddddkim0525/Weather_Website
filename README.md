Review:

1. Debouncer: Waits for user to finish an action before calling a function (Used in autocomplete)
2. MaterUI you need alot of components, they look nice, but looks boring. 
3. You can pass states in Reach Router. In react Router, you can extend the prop to add additional data. Look in to react-router
4. Adding CSS with material UI is quite confusing. I need to learn basic CSS
5. API Calls should be outside the react componenet. (Put util functions in /utils)
6. Functionality first before abstraction and refactoring.
